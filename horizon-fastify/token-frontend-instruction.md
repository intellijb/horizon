# Token Authentication Issue - Frontend Instructions

## Issue Identified

The `/auth/me` endpoint was returning 401 errors because the backend was not properly validating JWT tokens against the database.

## Root Cause

1. **JWT ID (JTI) Validation Missing**: When access tokens were created, their JTI (JWT ID) was stored in the database's `access_tokens` table. However, when validating tokens for authenticated endpoints, the backend only verified the JWT signature and expiry from the token itself, not checking if the JTI existed in the database.

2. **Database Schema**: The `access_tokens` table stores only the JTI (not the full token), along with expiration time and revocation status. This design pattern is correct for security but requires proper validation.

## What Was Fixed

The backend now performs complete token validation:
1. Verifies JWT signature and expiry (as before)
2. Checks if the JTI exists in the `access_tokens` table
3. Verifies the token is not revoked
4. Validates the token hasn't expired based on database record

## Frontend Impact

### No Frontend Changes Required

The frontend code does not need any modifications because:
- The token format remains the same
- The authentication flow is unchanged
- Error responses remain consistent (401 for invalid/expired tokens)

### Token Expiry

- Access tokens expire after **15 minutes**
- Refresh tokens expire after **7 days**
- The frontend should continue to:
  - Store the access token and refresh token securely
  - Use the refresh token to get a new access token when receiving 401 errors
  - Handle token expiry gracefully with the existing refresh flow

### Expected Behavior

1. **Normal Flow**: Token validation now properly checks database records, preventing expired or revoked tokens from being accepted
2. **Error Handling**: Continue handling 401 responses by attempting token refresh
3. **Token Storage**: Continue storing tokens as before - no changes needed

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify that login flow works correctly
2. Test that tokens expire after 15 minutes as expected
3. Confirm refresh token flow works properly
4. Ensure logout properly invalidates tokens

## Security Notes

This fix improves security by ensuring that:
- Revoked tokens cannot be used even if they have valid signatures
- Token expiry is enforced at the database level
- Each token is tracked with a unique JTI for audit purposes
